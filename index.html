        <br><span>Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It may be made from milk or cream and is 
        flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as 
        strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together.</span>

            <li><i><b>Chocolate Chip. :</b></i> Chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream is a popular ice cream flavor in which unbaked 
            chunks of

            </li>
            <li><i><b>Butter Pecan:</b></i>  Butter pecan is a flavor that merges the nutty notes of pecan with rich butter and a hint 
            of sweet 
            vanilla extract. The distinctive flavor of the pecan is hard to pinpoint – even for experts – but is perhaps best 
            described as having sweet, fat, and roasted undertones.
            </li>
            <li><i><b>Butterscotch:</b></i> Butterscotch is such a classic flavor, it's a wonder that butterscotch ice cream isn't more
